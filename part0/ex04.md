1. Whatever is typed into the form field is stored as user input, which is sent as data once the `Save` button is clicked, causing the submit event.
2. A POST request is sent to the server at the new_note address, which stores the new task in `notes`.
3. The browser is redirected to a GET request for the updated `notes` object at the address notes.
4. This reloads the page, at which point the next three requests are made:
   - A GET requerst is sent to fetch the `main.css` stylesheet.
   - The main JS file is also fetched.
   - Lastly, the icon image is fetched.
